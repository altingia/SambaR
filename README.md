# SambaR
Snp datA Management and Basic Analyses in R.

SambaR is a suite of custom-built functions and wrapper tools which allow users to import a SNP dataset into R and to perform quality control and population genetic analyses with a minimum number (i.e. â‰¤ 10) of commands. Summary statistics and analyses outcomes are automatically exported in ready to publish graphs with coherent layout (i.e. consistent font type, font size and colour coding based on population assignment).

To start using SambaR, simply download the files 'SAMBAR2019.txt' and 'sambaR_manual', and follow the instructions in the manual.
Example datasets are provided in the example datasets directory.
